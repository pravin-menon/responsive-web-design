     <p class="text-center">Shakuntala Devi was born in Bengaluru, Karnataka to a Kannada Brahmin family. Her father rebelled against becoming a temple priest and instead joined a circus where he worked as a trapeze artist, lion tamer, tightrope walker, and magician. He discovered his daughter's ability to memorize numbers while teaching her a card trick when she was about three years old. Her father left the circus and took her on road shows that displayed her ability at calculation. She did this without any formal education. At the age of six, she demonstrated her arithmetic abilities at the University of Mysore.</p>

      <p class="text-center">Here's a timeline of Shakuntala Devi's life:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-position: inside">
        <li><strong>1929</strong> - Born 4 November</li><br>
      <li><strong>1944</strong> - Moves to London with her father</li><br>
      <li><strong>1950</strong> - Toured Europe </li><br>
      <li><strong>1976</strong> - Toured New York City </li><br>
      <li><strong>1977</strong> - At Southern Methodist University, she gave the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in 50 seconds. Her answer 546,372,891 was confirmed by calculations done at the US Bureau of Standards by the UNIVAC 1101 computer, for which a special program had to be written to perform such a large calculation, which took longer time than her to do the same.</li><br>
        <li><strong>1977</strong> - She wrote <em>The World of Homosexuals</em>, the first study of homosexuality in India</li><br>
      <li><strong>1980</strong> - On 18th June, she demonstrated the multiplication of two 13-digit numbers—7,686,369,774,870 × 2,465,099,745,779 picked at random by the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. She correctly answered 18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730 in 28 seconds.</li><br>
      <li><strong>1982</strong> - This event was recorded in the Guinness Book of Records</li><br>
      <li><strong>1988</strong> - She travelled to US to have her abilities studied by Arthur Jensen, a professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Jensen tested her performance at several tasks, including the calculation of large numbers. Examples of the problems presented to Devi included calculating the cube root of 61,629,875 and the seventh root of 170,859,375. Jensen reported that Shakuntala Devi provided the solution to the above mentioned problems (395 and 15, respectively) before Jensen could copy them down in his notebook.</li><br>
        <li><strong>2013</strong> - Died on 21 April (<em>aged 83</em>)</li><br>
